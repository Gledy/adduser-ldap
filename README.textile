h2. To use adduser-ldap

You will need the ruby-ldap and highline libraries.

Ruby LDAP can be found at:

http://ruby-ldap.sourceforge.net/

Highline can be installed through rubygems:

$ gem install highline 

Stick the config.yml in /etc/adduser-ldap, and edit it for your site.

Then, use ./adduser-ldap like you would any regular adduser program.

By default, it will bind as the user running it, so they should have
administrative privileges to the directory.
